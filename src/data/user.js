			"I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Universitas Diponegoro, majoring in Computer Science/Informatics. My interest in software development brings me to be an always-curious person in how people's need to help their activities. In a case of developing software, it's not just me to write the code as what the requirements do, it's not. More than that, I love the process when helping them to clarify what they need the most, the process when iterating the blueprints such as databases, experiences, and keep monitoring it to know what comes after, whether problems to solve or innovations to improve.",
